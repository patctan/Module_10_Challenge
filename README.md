# Module_10_Challenge

This application is designed to create an HTML webpage that displays information for each person within a web development team, with the hopes of helping better organize and compile data for its users.

# Future Improvements

Currently, the cards being generated aren't visibly separate from each other and appear as floating text. I would like to go back and reformat the styling to have the information be displayed in a more organized and aesthetically pleasing manner.

Also, I would like to incorporate a link connecting the email address on the cards to the user's default email program, with the TO field of the email address not being filled in.

Finally, while cards do get rendered based on the information input into the prompts, a way to differentiate between the space set aside for the person's office number, GitHub account, or school have not been implemented. I would like to modify the program so that if the person is an engineer, their Github account will link to their Github page.
